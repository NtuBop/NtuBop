- 👋 Hi, I’m @NtuBop
- 👀 I’m interested in programming as a whole at the moment and have not yet found a specific area of interest.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JS.  I've had decent exposure to Python, Java, Flutter & Dart in the past, and am looking to bolster my understanding of Client/Server Architecture
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...  I'm not sure yet, I'll let you know in a few months-to-a-year or so.
